# Avoripe
 AvoRipe is a device that checks your avocado twice a day, or on-demand, sends you a notification to your smartphone if your avocado is ripe and allows you to track the softness of your avocado over time

Proudly created by Elad Goldberg and Eden Bar-Tov a from IDC Herzliya at the media innovation lab at IDC (MiLab).
A practical thanks to Zvika Markfeld, of ForRealTeam, for teaching us everything about IoT, supplied us with all the equipment.
